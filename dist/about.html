        <h3 class="text-secondary">BIO</h3>
        <p>From a very young age I was interested in tech, all I had to play with was radios, cars etc then progressed to computers and 
          programming and here I am today. I love my family and my city of Auckland in Aotearoa(NZ). 
        </p>
        <p> My other love is programming and have a passion for learning new things and ideas. 
          I would like nothing better than to get your online business or app up and running.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a little run down of what I can do for you...
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="job job-1">
        <h3>The Engineer</h3>
        <h6>Full Stack Developer</h6>
        <p>
          I have worked with current technologies such as the latest 
          versions of Javascript, React with Redux, Handlebars, Python 
          along with HTML on the front-end and node.js with express and SQLite, 
          MongoDB etc on the back-end. </p>
        <p>Flutter is my go-to for mobile which covers
          IOS and Android in one convenient language package.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="job job-2">
        <h3>The Designer</h3>
        <h6>Front End Developer</h6>
        <p>
          The part the customer sees begins with but is not limited to 
          technologies such as HTML 5, CSS 3, SASS and Styled components 
          to name a few but you can begin to imagine that you can 
          build exquisite things of beauty on the screen. 
          For mobile Flutter with material UI and cuppertino add-ons
          cover the UI duties for both Android and IOS respectively.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="job job-3">
        <h3>The Imagineer</h3>
        <h6> Designer</h6>
        <p>
          A digital designer is the culmination of a good eye and natural 
          artistic qualities which involve imagination and technologies, 
          sometimes pushing the envelope a bit until it becomes 
          a work of digital art.
