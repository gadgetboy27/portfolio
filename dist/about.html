        <h3 class="text-secondary">BIO</h3>
        <p>From a very young age I was interested in tech, all I had to play with was radios, cars etc then progressed to computers and 
          programming and here I am today. I love my family and my city of Auckland in Aotearoa(NZ). 
        </p>
        <p> My other love is programming and have a passion for learning new things and ideas. 
          I would like nothing better than to get your online business or app up and running.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a little run down of what I can do for you...
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="job job-1">
        <h3>The Engineer</h3>
        <h6>Full Stack Developer</h6>
        <p>The back-end or server side is where the engineering happens. 
          Technologies such as Node.JS, Express, MongoDB, SQlite Firestore 
          and cloud computing etc are but some of the tools required to get 
        your web and mobile apps functioning for your users storing passwords
        information and data to help customers navigate and use the internet 
      properly. I can help you solve these problems.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="job job-2">
        <h3>The Designer</h3>
        <h6>Front End Developer</h6>
        <p>
          The main UI the customer sees begins with but is not limited to 
          technologies such as HTML 5, CSS 3, SASS and Javascript incl React
          to name a few. Only the imagination holds you back from 
          what you can put on the screen. </p>
          For mobile, Flutter with material UI and cuppertino add-ons
          cover the UI duties for both Android and IOS respectively.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="job job-3">
        <h3>WEB 3.0</h3>
        <h6> Designer</h6>
        <p>
          From the humble beginnings of the internet fondly called 
          Web 1.0. Basically a digital newspaper and was read-only. From the 
          late 90's till today we are at Web 2.0 where interaction with 
          websites is the norm thanks to languages like Javascript, Python,
          PHP etc we can now interact with anyone around the world.</p>
          Enter Web 3.0 with the introduction of Bitcoin and it's 
          decentralized nature we are now free of everything that has caused 
          a stiffling of data sharing from information to Finance and more. 
          Web 3.0 is NOW!
